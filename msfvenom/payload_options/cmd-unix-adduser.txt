Basic options:
Name  Current Setting  Required  Description
----  ---------------  --------  -----------
PASS  Metasploit$1     yes       The password for this user
USER  metasploit       yes       The username to create

Description:
    Creates a new user. By default the new user is set with sudo
    but other options exist to make the new user automatically
    root but this is not automatically set since the new user will
    be treated as root (and login may be difficult). The new user
    can also be set as just a standard user if desired.
