Description:
    Execute a PHP payload as an OS command from a Posix-compatible shell.

    Spawn a shell on the established connection to
    the webserver.  Unfortunately, this payload
    can leave conspicuous evil-looking entries in the
    apache error logs, so it is probably a good idea
    to use a bind or reverse shell unless firewalls
    prevent them from working.  The issue this
    payload takes advantage of (CLOEXEC flag not set
    on sockets) appears to have been patched on the
    Ubuntu version of Apache and may not work on
    other Debian-based distributions.  Only tested on
    Apache but it might work on other web servers
    that leak file descriptors to child processes.
